    <p>Writing, visual art, and computer music are all areas of art, which is to say, they are all intensely subjective.
        In this project, we wanted to explore the translations between these artistic mediums by creating a creative
        interpretation of what a "writing style" might look like and sound like, as processed by our mathematical
        understandings and coding decisions, thus putting art forms that are normally separated in conversation with
        each other and giving the user something fun and open-ended to explore.</p>
