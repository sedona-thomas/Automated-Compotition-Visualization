    <h3>
        Background
    </h3>
    <p>Writing, visual art, and computer music are all areas of art, which is to say, they are all intensely subjective.
        In this project, we wanted to explore the translations between these artistic mediums by creating a creative
        interpretation of what a "writing style" might look like and sound like, as processed by our mathematical
        understandings and coding decisions, thus putting art forms that are normally separated in conversation with
        each other and giving the user something fun and open-ended to explore.</p>

        Automated Composition
    </h3>

    <p>
        Our project uses a Markov model trained on Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to generate a tune derived from the notes
        we generated during the text processing. This Markov chain calculates the probability that a given note will
        be followed by every other note then randomly generates future notes, weighted by their probability.

    <h3>
        Future Improvements
    </h3>

    <p>
        In the future, we hope to incorporate a feature for users to input a MIDI file to train the Markov chain, but we
        ran into many issues with importing the necessary functions.
